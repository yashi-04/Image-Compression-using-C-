# Image Compression using OpenCV

This project demonstrates image compression using OpenCV and multithreading in C++. It allows users to compress an image by specifying a compression level (0-100) and displays the original and compressed images side by side along with their sizes and compression percentage.

---

## Features
- Compresses images using JPEG compression.
- Displays the original and compressed images side by side.
- Shows the original size, compressed size, and compression percentage.
- Uses multithreading for efficient compression.
